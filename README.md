## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

### Model Overview
Our detection system employs a sophisticated Random Forest classifier trained on the comprehensive `fake_job_postings.csv` dataset, analyzing multiple dimensions of job posting authenticity.

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

**📝 Text Analysis**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts job descriptions, requirements, and benefits into numerical representations
- **Semantic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies linguistic patterns commonly associated with fraudulent postings
- **Keyword Importance Scoring**: Weights specific terms that correlate with legitimate vs. fake listings

**🔍 Metadata Intelligence**
- **Company Verification**: Analyzes presence and quality of company logos, profiles, and descriptions
- **Job Specification Analysis**: Evaluates experience requirements, education levels, and position details
- **Remote Work Indicators**: Assesses telecommuting flags and location consistency
- **Content Quality Metrics**: Measures text length, completeness, and professional language usage

**📊 Predictive Output**
The model generates probability scores indicating fraud likelihood, with interpretable confidence intervals for decision support.
